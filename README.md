## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the demand for taxi rides in New York City using historical data from July 2014. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is used for the forecasting task. LSTM models are well-suited for time series data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and handle sequences of varying lengths.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the file `dataset.csv`. It contains historical information about NYC taxi rides from July 2014, including features such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip duration, and timestamp. The dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for the LSTM model.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamMisar-12/nyc-taxi-lstm.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nyc-taxi-lstm
```

Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., venv) to isolate

the project dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The installation is now complete, and you're ready to use the project.

## Usage

Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

Open the `NYC Taxi Data Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train and evaluate the LSTM model on the NYC taxi dataset.

Experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and preprocessing techniques to improve the forecasting accuracy.
